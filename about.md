## About
I graduated with Bsc. In chemical engineering from federal University of technology owerri in imo state Nigeria and did my NYSC in lagos. 
In 2016 I enrolled in online certificate program with open University London on introduction to cyber security which was the basic and introductory part of cyber security and at this point my interest begin growing with IT.
I also enrolled in other short courses with Bitdegree, Coursera and technical support with Google programs. my little Johnny with IT have been very interesting and it's a right part to follow because everything you learn from it is useful somewhere. IT is also a part that welcomes anybody and everyone who chose to follow it and today I have found a new part in it "Cloud Solution Architect"
So guys join me in this inspiring jornny.
